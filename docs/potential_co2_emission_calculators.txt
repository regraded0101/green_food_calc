Chosen emmissions calculator:

DEFRA (gov.uk) factors. This is because it is a standardised measurement, endorsed by the UK government, for the emmissions calculations. 
The calculations will be carried out to provide a range of likely emmissions values, and will be measured in units of CO2 per units
of product. Exact calculations of CO2 values are unknown because there is not publically avaliable data on which ships contain which
food products. Any estimate at the likely CO2 values will be estimates and risk significantly under or over counting by under or over 
counting the number of ships containing food products.
